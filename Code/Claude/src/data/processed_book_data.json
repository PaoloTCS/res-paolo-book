It is also one of the most \ndifficult challenges because there are so many factors involved in \ncreating a successful company. This book helps budding \nentrepreneurs by providing specific knowledge that increases their \nlikelihood of success. It is often cited that only 10 out of 1,000 \nbusiness plans are funded, and only 1 out of 10 funded startups is \nsuccessful: either going public, being acquired or otherwise \ndelivering a high return on investment to shareholders. One reason \nfor this rather low ratio of 1 in 1,000 is that most entrepreneurs \nundertaking their first venture are not aware of all the landmines \nand pitfalls that await them on the road ahead. They often get \nfixated on the wrong issues and lose focus on what is important. \nThis book provides key tips to help first-time founders and \nneophytes to the business world to be among those who succeed. \nWhile success is never guaranteed, it is possible to increase the \nprobability of success by avoiding mistakes of unsuccessful \ncompanies. So let\u2019s get started on the road to success! \n \nThere are many ways to guide founders and entrepreneurs of \nstartup companies. We believe the most effective way is to provide \ngreat tips that have accumulated over the years. Tips are often \noffered as the keys to success by founders, experienced executives, \nindustry observers, venture capitalists and angel investors. For this \n"

It is easily read, understood and digested in a \nshort amount of time, but leads to long-lasting effects and positive \noutcomes if used properly. We provide the tip as a title in bold \nfollowed by a summary of the tip. Key points and takeaways are \nhighlighted when appropriate. For those interested in details, a \nlonger tutorial description is provided. With this format, you can \nadjust the manner in which you absorb the material based on your \ncircumstances: whether at an airport, on a plane, at work, in a coffee \nshop or on the beach.  \n \nStartup entrepreneurs are usually short of time and want to access \ninformation quickly, and then go deeper when they really need to \nget more information. They do not want to wade through volumes \nof superfluous content to extract the nuggets of useful information. \nThe knowledge they seek is usually associated with a big decision \non some important issue. We know all too well that early decisions \nhave the biggest impact on the long-term success of a startup. So we \nhave collected the best tips that allow you to make good decisions \nearly in the process, thereby increasing the likelihood of success.  \n \nThe style of this book is one of giving advice in a coffee shop. \nAnyone involved in a startup, whether a founder, manager or \nemployee, would like to sit in a coffee shop for a few hours with \nsomeone who has \u201cbeen there and done that\u201d to get some good \ninput and advice.

I have my thoughts and \nwhat I think are my formulas for success. But everyone is different. \nEvery company is different. What are the common factors that \nwould work for everyone?  \n \nThis is a great book for anyone thinking about starting a company. \nAlthough the book is targeted for high technology, I find much of it \nto be applicable to other types of startups, especially those that are \nor aim to be venture backed. \n \nPerhaps more importantly, the arrangement of the book in the \n\u201ctips\u201d format makes this a great reference book. Most of the advice \nfor how to start a company is also about how to continue to grow a \ncompany. Scrolling through just the list of tips, I can tell which tips \nare relevant to me now, and go to that section to read the advice \nand reminders. In reading through the manuscript, I often caught \nmyself thinking about how a particular tip or anecdote might apply \nto me right now in growing the eight-year old company I have the \nprivilege to lead. \n \nI have known the authors of this book since 1997 when I joined \nSimplex as COO. I have been a founder of two software product \ncompanies, have helped two other companies grow from tens of \nemployees to public companies while serving as an inside Board \nmember in several operating roles, and have been on the Board of \nthree other companies as an external Board member, all with \nsuccessful M&A exits.  \n \n"

Our company was a chip-design software startup \nin a sea of questionable Internet startups. We provided software for \nintegrated circuit designers that solved some serious customer \nproblems arising from an inflection point in the semiconductor \nindustry. We had real products, real customers, real revenue and \nreal profits, almost unheard of in the Internet startup era. In 2000, \nthe tech bubble burst. But we did not! We continued to grow as a \ncompany. Our CEO, Penny Herscher, through sheer force of will \nand persistence, took our company public in 2001 \u2013 a time when \nunderwriters and investment bankers were spooked by the carnage \non Wall Street the prior year. A year later it was sold to a larger \ncompany for $300M.  \n \nThe genesis of our company began back in 1994. We started by \nwriting conference and journal papers together as professors at \nDuke University and the University of Illinois. We lived in the land \nof \u201cpublish or perish\u201d where we were changing the world \u201cone \nstudent at a time.\u201d The university is a great environment for \ninnovation but we yearned to have a bigger impact. We began \nthinking about starting a company and made the decision in \nJanuary of 1995 to quit our jobs, move to California and launch our \nstartup. \n \nThat company was Simplex Solutions. We started with the lofty \ngoal of solving all of the problems arising from deep-submicron \ntechnology by building a set of software tools to inspect chip \ndesigns before they were manufactured. We built a great team of \ncofounders, advisors, investors, managers and of course products. \nThe flagship product gained traction in the marketplace and, along \n"

Of \ncourse, by that time the competition had similar tools so they shared \nin the glory. But we were first to market with a working killer \nproduct. We made the impact we had set off to accomplish.  \n \nLooking back, it seems like it was a straight line to success even \nthough it did not feel that way at the time. We made right decisions \non major factors that determined success or failure. We did a lot of \nhard work up front to validate our plans before setting off to build a \ncompany. We took all the advice we could get and used it where we \nfelt it was most valuable. We pulled in some heavy hitters as early \nas possible and combined their experience and know how with \nours. We now have a unique perspective on how to build fast-\ngrowing startups. One thing we learned is that if you are highly \nallergic to taking advice, you will fail. We succeeded because we \nwere able to convert advice into action and did not let a \u201cknow-it-\nall\u201d attitude get in the way of building a great company. \n \nSince then, we have been involved individually and together in \nmultiple startups, in both hardware and software. Most of them \nended in acquisitions. A few did not make it. Others are still \nongoing. But through the initial public offerings, mergers, \nacquisitions and the ones that did not fly, we identified other \ncriteria that lead to successful startups. We gave talks at MIT \nentrepreneurship forums and began investing as angels. In that \nprocess, we were able to exchange ideas with other entrepreneurs, \ninvestors and industry observers about what makes a startup \nsuccessful. We began to realize why we were able to start a \ncompany that went public while others struggled to get theirs off \nthe ground or stay afloat. We compiled a list of the success factors \n"

Today, ideas can come from \nanywhere: hacking code in a dorm room, playing with leading-edge \ntechnology in a college lab, working on a cool app in a home office, \nwriting down thoughts on the back of a napkin, exchanging ideas at \na technical conference, or just thinking up a new concept in the \nshower that \"just might have some commercial value.\" Regardless of \nhow it happens or where it happens, when the light bulb goes on, it \nmay be time to spring into action.  \n \nAnyone with the right mindset can be an entrepreneur. If you \nidentify a problem encountered by many businesses or individuals \nwho would pay for a solution you are capable of developing, you \nshould think about becoming an entrepreneur. In fact, anyone in \nSTEM (science, technology, engineering and math) has the potential \nto start a high-tech company today. Considering the number of \npeople in the world with a STEM background, this is a staggering \nnumber. As a result, this century will be defined technology and \ntalent. \n \nToday, there are technology startups in software, hardware, \nsemiconductors, networking, automotive, biotech, clean energy, \nbusiness services, and consumer goods and services, to name a few. \nSoftware startups tend to dominate the landscape because they are \nmuch easier to get off the ground than ever before.

In fact, many small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) \nhave sprouted up in the past five years with the potential to scale \nup quickly if the appropriate funding can be secured. Often, these \ncompanies will start off with developers, engineers, consultants, \nadvisors, and data entry people in different locations, thus forming \nwhat is ostensibly a virtual company. Once it reaches critical mass, \nsome consolidation into one or two locations may be needed \nbecause of the economies of scale. However, until that point, it is \nquite possible to operate a distributed fashion using the cloud-based \ninfrastructure available today on the Internet. \n \nSimilarly, building hardware with embedded software is not as \nexpensive or difficult as it was in the past. At the present time, a \nsingle-board computer (SBC) can be quickly designed using off-the-\nshelf parts with proprietary software running on it. There are well-\nknown groups generating very innovative SBC\u2019s that can shorten \ndevelopment time for new startups. It is much easier to iterate on \nprototypes and determine if they have potential value in industry. \nIn addition, relatively inexpensive offshore manufacturing and \nthree-dimensional (3D) printing are readily available to shorten the \ntime for hardware design revisions.  \n \nWhile hardware and software startups are easier to launch, the hard \npart is making them successful. Actually, this is true regardless of \nthe type of startup. Most entrepreneurs believe their technical \nexpertise will carry them a long way on the road to success. On the \ncontrary, it is the ability to make the right business decisions, \nbuild a team of talented people, negotiate contracts, attract \nfunding and handle the myriad of business issues that will \ndetermine success. Only a small but essential part of a successful \nstartup is due to the technical prowess of the founders. Their \nbusiness acumen is much more important.

If your goal is to start a company at \nsome point in the future, there are many things you can do in \npreparation. \n \nFirst, generate lots of ideas on how to improve things. These ideas \ncan be small, medium, large or even grandiose. Thinking, tinkering \nand trying different approaches will produce many more ideas. Act \non these ideas by developing solutions to specific problems. Many \npeople spend hours on Facebook, playing video games or binge-\nwatching TV programs. Instead, use that time to write software \nprograms or assemble hardware systems. If you are not completely \nconsumed (or possessed) by the excitement of building systems and \ntrying to solve different problems in new ways, a startup may not \nbe for you. But if you love to immerse yourself in problem solving \ntasks and lose yourself in the technology, you are definitely well \nsuited to starting a company. \n \nSecond, become an expert in an emerging field and become highly \nskilled in that field. You can do this at the graduate level in a \ncollege or in your spare time. This will take many hours over many \nweeks, months and years. When you consider the high skill levels of \nMichael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky, you should realize that they \npracticed their craft continuously over many years to reach the level \nof \"best in their sport.\" Likewise, you must work hard and be very \npassionate about what you are doing to reach a high level of \nproficiency in your field.

But the inexperienced entrepreneur usually does not \nrealize it until long after the company has closed its doors.  \n \nTo avoid this fatal mistake, the entrepreneur must learn how to \ndifferentiate between ideas that solve a customer problem and ideas \nthat are worthless. The ratio of good commercial ideas to bad ones \nis 1 to 10,000, so your task is to determine why the idea won\u2019t \nwork before going any further. And when you do, you need to hit \nthe self-destruct button on the idea and move on to another one that \nsolves a customer problem and serves a large market need. \n \nKey point: Be the harshest critic of your own idea, technology \nand product.

An idea is a creative \nconcept, which may or may not have commercial value, whereas a \nproduct is something a customer wants to buy. Ideas have far less \nvalue compared to products. But founders tend to be idea-centric \nand they place enormous value on them. Oftentimes, they \nmistakenly believe their idea is the product. Furthermore, they \nthink the hard part is to come up with the original technical idea \nwhile it is relatively easy to build a product. In reality, ideas are \ncheap but it is very difficult to build a complete product that will \nsell and much more difficult to build a company around the \nproduct. Many people have many great ideas, but very few of them \nlead to a product or a viable company. There are rare exceptions to \nthis rule, like Facebook, and this is unfortunately what leads many \nentrepreneurs to think their idea is the next big thing.  \n \nIf you have a new idea for a product, your first job is to figure out \nthe limitations of your idea. The strengths are obvious to you \nbecause you do not see any flaws, at least none that cannot be fixed \nover time. But there is likely to be one major flaw and you must \nfigure out what it is. Bad ideas will sink the company. If you can \nfind the main problem with your idea before others do, it will save \neveryone a lot of time, money, frustration and failure. More \noptimistically, it is the first step in making you think critically \nabout ideas from a business perspective rather than a technical \nperspective. This shift in thinking is perhaps the most important \nchange to make for first-time entrepreneurs.  \n \nConsider this metaphor. A customer accidently cuts themselves on \nthe foot and is bleeding (red ink). They need a tourniquet to stop the \nbleeding, then an ointment for rapid healing of the wound.

These issues are \nassociated with the business model. If you get it right, you win big. \nMany companies have failed when they get the business model \nwrong. The key to a proper business model is to ensure that the \nbusiness is scalable. Two integral parts of the business model are \nproduct pricing and the cost of goods sold. A scalable business has \nhigh margins, i.e., the difference between the product price and the \ncost of goods sold.

If the sales cycle is \nvery long, the cost of goods sold high and the margins small, it will \nbe difficult to increase revenue year over year.

A lack of competitors may be a red \nflag for your product, especially if you are having trouble getting \ncustomers to engage with you. So competitors actually validate \nyour product plans. Customers help you build the right product; \ncompetitors force you to build a better product. Once released, \ncompetitors will attempt to duplicate your effort through reverse \nengineering, or perhaps they have also been working on a similar \nproduct during the same period as you. You need to create barriers \nto entry so you can meet your revenue projections in the presence of \ncompetitors. As long as your product is significantly better than the \ncompetition, you will be able to gain traction in the marketplace. \n \nConsider the analogy of defending a castle in the middle ages. In \norder to stop an invading army from overtaking your castle, you \nneed to build a moat and a high wall, and if they get past these two \nbarriers, you fire cannons or drop boiling hot cauldrons of oil on \nthem. In a similar way, you must build business and technical \nbarriers to entry for your products. This metaphor is useful as a \nconstant reminder to build in competitive barriers and safeguards \ninto your product and all your business practices prior to engaging \nthe market. It is a battle for survival and you must win. \n \nThe first step is to identify all competitors (both big and small) with \nproducts in your market space, and then carry out coarse-grain and \nfine-grain analyses of product differentiation. This information is \nused in the business plan to describe the competitive environment \nfor your product and how you expect to mitigate risks associated \nwith the competition. \n \n"

Cash is \nneeded to build the first working product, which, in turn, is used to \nraise more cash or bring in revenue. The two are interconnected. \nThis must be clearly understood by all involved. As the company \ngrows, the CEO and VP of Engineering are the two people \nultimately responsible for keeping their eye on the ball. As a result, \nthe CEO and VP of Engineering must have a close working \nrelationship in a startup. \n \nJob ONE of the CEO in a startup is to manage cash. The burn rate \nshould be low enough to hit all milestones with some room to \nspare, typically one or two extra months. This practice should \ncontinue until the company is profitable. Keeping an eye on the \nburn rate in the early days is the only way to delay the next round \nof financing as long as possible. A burn rate chart can be \nconstructed based on monthly expenses to determine how many \nmonths of funding are left and when to begin fund-raising \nactivities. Big budgets and wild spending are for the big companies. \nAs a startup, you need to stretch every dollar and control spending \nto get the company to profitability, grow the revenue, or get to the \nnext round of funding. Having just enough money to stay hungry, \nnot too little so that you starve or not so much that you get \ncomplacent, is perhaps the best way to operate in the first two \nyears. \n \nTip #42 \n"

Testing is done \nconcurrently with development to maintain quality. \n \nImplementing agile methods involves interactions between many \ndifferent groups and processes as well as many revisions of the \nsoftware produced on a frequent basis. The overall process must be \nmanaged in a coherent manner; otherwise, it may end up being \nchaotic and less effective. DevOps and continuous delivery are used \nto facilitate agile methods.

This is a difficult question to \nanswer with certainty at the outset but there are leading indicators \nthat should be examined before going ahead with the startup. Two \nfactors that determine scalability are the cost of goods sold (COGS) \nand the revenue from the customer.

However, the main features are relatively easy to \ngrasp. It begins with the notion that customers will sign up for the \nservice (movies, music, dashboards, etc.) and pay a monthly (or \nperhaps annual) fee. The metrics to assess the viability of such a \nbusiness are collectively called Unit Economics, where the unit is \none user or customer.

Assume \nthat the subscription fee for a service is $50/month. This is referred \nto as the monthly recurring revenue (MRR). Customers can either \nsubscribe (acquisition), continue with the service and perhaps \nupgrade (retention), or drop the service altogether (churn).

For example, if the \npost-money valuation of a startup is $10M and the company has \n20M shares fully-diluted, the strike price is set to $0.50/share for \ninvestors.

They are risking their own money but fully understand the \nrisk as sophisticated investors. If you are trying to raise $500K, then \nangel funding is a good option. Angel investors may give you a pre-\nmoney valuation of around $1.5M.

The \nbad news is you have to earn your percentage ownership by staying \nwith the company for a number of years. This process of earning \nyour shares back is called vesting. The standard vesting period is 4 \nyears in most financing deals. It is possible to negotiate a deal where \nyou get 1/5 fully vested if you have spent 1 year trying to get the \ncompany off the ground. However, the remaining 4/5 is still subject \nto vesting over the next four years. Usually, 1/48th of your shares \nwill be earned every month for 48 months. This vesting schedule is \nabsolutely necessary to keep founders committed to the company. \nThis also clarifies how much stock is forfeited if a founder leaves the \ncompany early. Therefore, each founder has a strong incentive to \nstay with the company for many years and drive up the stock price \nby achieving milestones through hard work.

This means, if there is a \nliquidation event, the investors are paid first in accordance with the \nfinancing agreement and common-share holders are paid after that. \nHowever, the price of the common shares may be set to one-tenth of \nthe price of the preferred shares. They are cheaper to buy and \nprovide a mechanism for employees to have an ownership stake in \nthe company. For example, preferred shares may cost $0.25/share \nfor investors, called the strike price, whereas common stock may be \npriced at $0.03/share for employees. Since the price per share \nusually increases at every round of financing, and perhaps between \nrounds if the Board dictates, employees are given a strong incentive \nto join the company at a very early stage because the stock is \ncheaper. They are usually given stock options, that is, the option to \nbuy stock at the price set when they join the company as part of the \ncompensation package. The 4-year vesting schedule on stock \noptions applies to all employees, including the CEO and \nmanagement.  \n \nGiven this arrangement, it is important to set aside a suitable \npercentage, in this case 30%, as an employee stock pool. This gives \nyou the ability to hire the very best people using stock options \nwithout further dilution. The reason for the high percentage \nallocated to the pool is because you will need a large number of \npeople to build a great company, and that is not going to come \ncheaply. In fact, greed has no place in the context of wealth creation. \nEach person will need to have a piece of the action as part of the \ncompensation package to feel that they are working for themselves \nand the company at all times. This is the best way to engender a \nsense of teamwork and common purpose - through the issuance of \ncommon stock to all employees. As such, the value of the 30% stock \npool is enormous. \n"

However, the landscape of venture \nfinancing has changed considerably over the past 20 years. This \nimpacts the timing of when funds are available for startups so it is \nimportant to follow the trends in the VC world. In the mid-90's, \nmoney was free-flowing and you could still get funded with a \nbusiness plan and a good pitch. There were approximately 5000 \nventure capitalists in 400 VC firms at the time. The Internet was in \nits infancy and VC funds were loaded up with cash so companies \nlike Netscape, Amazon, Yahoo and many others were funded, \nalongside those who wanted to sell lipstick over the Internet. Good \nmoney quickly found bad companies in a landscape that resembled \nthe Wild West.  \n \nUnfortunately, the hey-day of funding everything in sight, and \nmoney chasing anything that moved without proper due diligence, \ncame to a crashing end when the Internet bubble burst in 2000. It \nwas only a matter of time before everyone realized that having \"dot \ncom\" in your name with 200 people hacking code in a building \nproduced mostly vaporware and broken promises. Of course, the \nnames that we recognize today survived that period and have \nbecome giants of the industry.  \n \nThe VCs were not badly burned at first since many of their portfolio \ncompanies went public with over-inflated valuations prior to the \ncrash even though they had no product, no sales and no future \nTip #26 \n"

Here, \nliquidation refers to an event whereby the company is sold through \nacquisition (in the best case) or declares bankruptcy (in the worst \ncase). Liquidation preference is a way to give downside protection \nto investors in case the company is sold before an IPO. It guarantees \nthat any investors with preferred stock will be paid back first, often \nwith a multiple on their investment. The founders and other \ncommon stock holders receive payment based on their pro rata \ncommon stock portions with what is left of the proceeds of the sale \nafter investors are paid off. The liquidation preference clause does \nnot apply if the company goes public - only if it is sold. But most \ncompanies are acquired which makes liquidation preference a very \nimportant clause in the agreement. \n  \nKey point: In the VC negotiations, the goal of the founders is to \npush the multiplier on liquidation preference as close to 1X as \npossible. A more typical value is 2X or 3X. A 3X multiple means \nthat investors receive three times their investment if there is a \nliquidation event. If there are many VCs chasing your deal, it is \npossible to push the multiplier close to 1X because you have \nleverage.

Then, you lose your money. If it is \nacquired by another company or otherwise liquidated in some form, \nthere will be proceeds of the liquidation. As an investor, you expect \nto at least get your money back, which is a 1X return. If the selling \nprice is high enough, you expect to get a higher return before any \nnon-investors get their portion of the proceeds because startups are \nvery high-risk investments.

Otherwise, their investors are not going to like \nthe returns and will be reluctant to participate in the next fund. The \nliquidation preference specifies the minimum return for investors \nupon any liquidation event.

Instead of running out of cash, a \nconvertible note can be used to bridge the gap. This is perhaps the \nmost common scenario for the convertible note, which is referred to \nas a bridge note if used in this context. If private investors, who \nbelieve in the company, can raise the needed funds, they can be part \nof the next round of financing. In addition, the funds associated \nwith the note can be used as leverage to obtain a higher valuation at \nthe next round.

Often, min/max valuations, called caps, are \nspecified in the note to accommodate these conflicting interests. \n \nWhen the note is converted to preferred shares, there may be a \ndiscount applied to the preferred share price depending on the \nterms of the convertible note agreement.

For \nexample, if the price is set to $0.50/share at the next round and a \n10% discount is part of the note agreement, the note holder would \npay $0.45/share.

This is one \naspect of a startup environment that must be embraced by everyone \nbecause its survival depends on it.  \n \nThe first step in building an environment promoting agility is to \nhire people in management who are team players. They must be \nvery experienced and highly qualified, but they must also believe \nthe strength of the startup is in the agility of the team. A bunch of \noutstanding individuals in the same room who are Prima Donnas \nwill produce mostly arguments, not results. In a startup, team \nchemistry is extremely important. If the team works well together, \nthey will be able to quickly figure out how to solve problems and \nthere will be no challenge that is too great. If they are constantly at \nodds with each other, it erodes the ability to solve problems and \ntake action. Every wasted minute is a delay element on the critical \npath to success. \n \nAgility in a startup is about a team-oriented mindset. Team players \nare solution-centric, not problem-centric. They want to point the \nway forward, not engage in finger pointing. They prefer to solve a \nproblem, not dwell on how they got into it. They trust each other to \nget the job done. They respect each other\u2019s talents. They love \nTip #31 \n"

Other \nexecutives require an order of magnitude less.   \n2. CEO integrity is critical. Many startups have been effectively \nkilled by opportunistic greedy CEOs.

Each of the 10 decisions is \ndiscussed in more detail below. \n \nSelection of the Founding Team: The selection of the founding \nteam is the first and perhaps most important decision in starting the \ncompany. The founding team must be technically competent, \nextremely passionate about starting a company, trustworthy, \nreliable and have a strong work ethic. You will be living with them \nfor years so team chemistry is very important. The core competence \nof the company is based on the founding team.

The product/market fit and the product timing for that \nmarket are critical to success.

The development of \u201cmust-have\u201d products \nleads to a successful company. For \u201cnice-to-have\u201d products, it must \nhelp the customer to reduce their costs, reduce their time-to-market, \nor enhance their own product in some manner. Otherwise, it will \nnot succeed.

Typically, the initial funds are \ncontributed by the founders, and later by a small group of \nunsophisticated investors comprised of friends and family. The goal \nof bootstrapping a company is to build value and grow organically \nuntil you reach profitability. If you are building a fast-growing \ncompany, you will need to pursue knowledgeable investors with \ndeep pockets at some point. You should identify angels or venture \ncapitalists that have in depth knowledge of your industry and have \nthe key expertise to help build your company. Angel funding levels \nare in the range of $150K-$500K per angel group, and total $200K-\n$1M when a number of angel groups pool their assets. Venture \ncapital financing starts in the range of $1-10M with a very high bar \nto secure funding. Both expect equity in return. If revenues grow \nexponentially, you may need to pursue angels or VCs for funding to \nscale your business. \n \nHiring a CEO: It will be necessary for one of the founders to carry \nout the duties of a CEO until you decide to hire one. An \ninexperienced founder should not attempt to run the company for a \nlengthy period of time because it will decrease the probability of \nsuccess. If you choose to take on this responsibility or work with \nanother employee who can serve as President to assist you, keep the \nfollowing in mind. The CEO must manage the burn rate between \nrounds of financing and keep it low enough to get to profitability or \nthe next round, whichever comes first.

For example, the selection of \nthe first product to build and the timing of next round of financing \nare both critical decisions. If the product does not work or the \ncompany runs out of cash, the outcome is usually disastrous. To \nimprove the likelihood of success even under these conditions, you \nneed to think about what you will do if your initial plan is not \nsuccessful. You need to have a backup plan and a contingency plan \nto mitigate your risk.  \n \nThe primary plan is called the action plan. It is high risk but \nprovides a high reward, if successful. A backup plan is enabled only \nif the action plan fails. The backup plan has medium risk and \nmedium reward. But if this also fails, you need to consider a \u201cred-\nzone\u201d contingency plan. This is the lowest risk option, but the \nreturn is also low. However, it prevents the company from \ncompletely failing. You also need to consider the triggers that \nactivate the backup and contingency plans. \n \nThis approach of having three plans is sometimes referred to as the \nABC method of planning.

Many founders have misjudged \nthe opportunity to sell the company because it is not an easy \ndecision to make if the company is making slow but steady \nprogress. \n \nIf the company is truly struggling and a low-ball offer arrives to sell \nthe company, the investors may push for a sale due to multiple \nliquidation preference rights in the financing agreement. If the \ninvestors receive a multiple on their initial investment under the \nterms of the agreement, they may be able to convince other Board \nmembers to vote to sell the company. This is something to watch \nout for because investors are quick on the draw for liquidation if \nthey can reduce the time to receive a return on a seemingly bad \ninvestment.  \n \nConsider the following example for illustrative purposes. You raise \n$2M from VCs in exchange for 33% of the company. Let us assume \nthat a 2X multiple is part of the liquidation preference clause in the \nfinancing contract. The 2X multiple means the investors will receive \na minimum payment of $4M upon liquidation. As a founder or \nCEO, you must ensure the company sells for more than $4M or you \nwill not see one penny. The VCs take the first $4M of the sale price \nso they will be quite happy with the outcome of a sale as low as \n$4M, but the founders and employees will be left with nothing.

If the VCs get impatient with the progress being \nmade by the company, they may try to find a willing suitor for an \nacquisition at any price above $4M. The backdrop to this situation is \nthat the company has not met its milestones, either due to poor \nexecution, no market, bad pivoting strategies and so on. This is the \nrange where the management and Board have major differences of \nopinion on the next step and the Boardroom battle begins. Rather \nthan battle the Board, it may be time to cut bait and move on to the \nnext company. Unfortunately, the final decision is in the hands of \nthe Board, not the management team. \n \nOn the other hand, if the company is making good progress, the \nBoard will not consider selling the company because of the \npossibility of much higher returns. For any sale above $12M, the \nVCs will not exercise their liquidation preference clause as they \nstand to make more by converting to common stock and taking 33% \nof the proceeds.

This is the most likely outcome of a successful \nstartup. You have to know when an exit makes sense and when to \nenjoy the fruits of your labor.

The contract structure of future product sales \nand associated revenue credit may impact the ability to \nachieve milestones. The acquirer\u2019s sales team may have little \nincentive to sell your product, which would limit your \nability to hit any target revenues established in the contract. \nFor you, the acquisition is not complete until you have met \nall milestones for your earn-outs.  \n3.
